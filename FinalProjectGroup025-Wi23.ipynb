    "The goal of this project is to design a more organic recommendation system for music, leveraging the Spotify API. The recorded data quantifies various characteristics of songs, including acousticness, danceability, and energy, allowing songs to be compared numerically to one another. With these metrics, the relationship and parameters of a users' given playlist can be quantified, and songs that share similar qualities to those in the playlist can be recommended. Additionally, songs with a smaller similarity score can be recommended to determine whether the user may like other genres beyond the ones already in their playlist, allowing the recommendation system to feel more organic. The success of this model can be determined based on a measure of how long and how many times recommended songs are played, as well as potential changes in the overall composition of measured parameters in the user's playlist."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill in the background and discuss the kind of prior work that has gone on in this research area here. **Use inline citation** to specify which references support which statements.  You can do that through HTML footnotes (demonstrated here). I used to reccommend Markdown footnotes (google is your friend) because they are simpler but recently I have had some problems with them working for me whereas HTML ones always work so far. So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of inline citation. After government genocide in the 20th century, real birds were replaced with surveillance drones designed to look just like birds<a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#lorenznote). Use a minimum of 2 or 3 citations, but we prefer more <a name=\"admonish\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#admonishnote). You need enough citations to fully explain and back up important facts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remeber you are trying to explain why someone would want to answer your question or why your hypothesis is in the form that you've stated. \n",

    "When looking at which topic we wanted to focus our project on, we came by an interesting paper, 'ALGORITHMS AND CURATED PLAYLIST EFFECT ON MUSIC STREAMING SATISFACTION'<a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#lorenznote), where it studied the effects of algorthmically created playlists and it's effects on the users. It found that the more the user intereacted with the music streaming app, the more satisfied they were with the curated playlist<a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#lorenznote). If algorthmically curated music had such an effect on listeners, then we thought it would be a great idea to create our own program that created playlists based off of the songs the listeners liked. But there was one issue we battled wihth when we came across the study,'Algorithmic Effects on the Diversity of Consumption on Spotify<a name=\"admonish\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#admonishnote). This paper explained how algorthmicly created playlists have less music diversity and when people listened to diverse music, they moved away from algorthmic comsumption and increased their organic consumption<a name=\"admonish\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#admonishnote). But this flaw in algorthmically curated platlists sparked the idea for our group to attempt to create a playlist that as closely as possible reflected organically consumed, diverse music. "

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly describe the problem that you are solving. Avoid ambiguous words. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one ML-relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms), measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we are attempting to solve is the idea that algorithmic playlists, as in playlists generated using an algorithm, are not as diverse as organically curated music playlists. As described in our background, if a user enjoys the curated playlist created algorithmically, there is a higher retention rate on the application. However, the con of algorithmic playlists is that they are not diverse as compared to organically curated playlists leading to users stepping away from the algorithmic palylists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many algorithms struggle with organic recommendation systems, instead prioritizing the recommendation of content users are already interested in. The interest of users can be quantified by how long and how many times they may engage with a certain creator, piece of media, or other form of content, with better recommendations having greater amounts of engagement than poorer recommendations. Furthermore, time on the platform, like ratios, and user-driven recommendations can be used as further parameters to quantify how good these recommendations are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, by creating a model that can curate a playlist algorithmically, but also have a diverse enough selection of music, the client, in this case Spotify, can retain the userbase that would have stepped away towards the more organically diverse curated music. Taking this into account, algorithms instead must replicate the sporadicity of organic recommendations, and determine methods of predicting new content the user will enjoy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our solution we plan on solving this using the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to generate a playlist of songs based on an initial query song."

    "In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Provide enough detail (e.g., algorithmic description and/or theoretical properties) to convince us that your solution is applicable. Make sure to describe how the solution will be tested.  \n",

    "Our solution to the problem of organic machine recommendation systems is the implementation of both batch and stochastic gradient descent methods, as well as k fold cross validation to create a system that is able to recommend things organically. Since our dataset contains much of the data regarding songs that we already need, batch gradient descent is well suited to create a principle set of weights for the algorithm to use, which can then be updated in real time using stochastic gradient descent. In this manner, the online nature of stochastic gradient descent will allow for the recommendation system to evolve with the users' preferences, and thus grow from the hot start generated by the batch gradient descent. The lighter computational complexity of stochastic gradient descent allows for the use of k folds cross validation as well,  allowing us to score new recommendations based on theorized metrics and determine how well the model is operating. By doing so, the stochastic algorithm weights can be changed if it is measured that recommendations do poorly, or reinforced if recommendations do well. In this manner, the algorithm can be tested, and would be viable to solving the issue of organic recommendation."

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",

    "Propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the context of predicting new music content, the evaluation metric we will be using is accuracy. This is because we want to determine if the music that our machine learning model is predicting is actually music that makes sense to be played. One possible way to determine how accurate our model is to create our own playlists/sets of songs and determining whether the music predicted by our model falls in that playlist. \n",

    "\n",
    "OK, you've given us quite a bit of tech informaiton above, now its time to tell us what to pay attention to in all that.  Think clearly about your results, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Highlight HOW your results support those points.  You probably want 2-5 sentences per point.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to generate the data that the model will take to generate a recommended playlist, the user has to input information regarding the types of songs they listen to, whether they're fine with explicitness, and other variables such as if they want their playlist to be dancable. In order for the user to understand how their data is being used, we plan on writing explicitly how their account would be used in conjunction with our project and stick to those written conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Reiterate your main point and in just a few sentences tell us how your results support it. Mention how this work would fit in the background/context of other work in this field if you can. Suggest directions for future work if you want to."
