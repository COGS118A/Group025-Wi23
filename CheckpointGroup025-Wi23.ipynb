    "# Abstract \n",
    "The goal of this project is to design a more organic recommendation system for music, leveraging the Spotify API. The recorded data quantifies various characteristics of songs, including acousticness, danceability, and energy, allowing songs to be compared numerically to one another. With these metrics, the relationship and parameters of a users' given playlist can be quantified, and songs that share similar qualities to those in the playlist can be recommended. Additionally, songs with a smaller similarity score can be recommended to determine whether the user may like other genres beyond the ones already in their playlist, allowing the recommendation system to feel more organic. The success of this model can be determined based on a measure of how long and how many times recommended songs are played, as well as potential changes in the overall composition of measured parameters in the user's playlist."
