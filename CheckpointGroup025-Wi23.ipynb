    "# Abstract \n",
    "The goal of this project is to design a more organic recommendation system for music, leveraging the Spotify API. The recorded data quantifies various characteristics of songs, including acousticness, danceability, and energy, allowing songs to be compared numerically to one another. With these metrics, the relationship and parameters of a users' given playlist can be quantified, and songs that share similar qualities to those in the playlist can be recommended. Additionally, songs with a smaller similarity score can be recommended to determine whether the user may like other genres beyond the ones already in their playlist, allowing the recommendation system to feel more organic. The success of this model can be determined based on a measure of how long and how many times recommended songs are played, as well as potential changes in the overall composition of measured parameters in the user's playlist."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at which topic we wanted to focus our project on, we came by an interesting paper, 'ALGORITHMS AND CURATED PLAYLIST EFFECT ON MUSIC STREAMING SATISFACTION'<a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#lorenznote), where it studied the effects of algorthmically created playlists and it's effects on the users. It found that the more the user intereacted with the music streaming app, the more satisfied they were with the curated playlist<a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#lorenznote). If algorthmically curated music had such an effect on listeners, then we thought it would be a great idea to create our own program that created playlists based off of the songs the listeners liked. But there was one issue we battled wihth when we came across the study,'Algorithmic Effects on the Diversity of Consumption on Spotify<a name=\"admonish\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#admonishnote). This paper explained how algorthmicly created playlists have less music diversity and when people listened to diverse music, they moved away from algorthmic comsumption and increased their organic consumption<a name=\"admonish\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#admonishnote). But this flaw in algorthmically curated platlists sparked the idea for our group to attempt to create a playlist that as closely as possible reflected organically consumed, diverse music. "

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we are attempting to solve is the idea that algorithmic playlists, as in playlists generated using an algorithm, are not as diverse as organically curated music playlists. As described in our background, if a user enjoys the curated playlist created algorithmically, there is a higher retention rate on the application. However, the con of algorithmic playlists is that they are not diverse as compared to organically curated playlists leading to users stepping away from the algorithmic palylists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many algorithms struggle with organic recommendation systems, instead prioritizing the recommendation of content users are already interested in. The interest of users can be quantified by how long and how many times they may engage with a certain creator, piece of media, or other form of content, with better recommendations having greater amounts of engagement than poorer recommendations. Furthermore, time on the platform, like ratios, and user-driven recommendations can be used as further parameters to quantify how good these recommendations are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, by creating a model that can curate a playlist algorithmically, but also have a diverse enough selection of music, the client, in this case Spotify, can retain the userbase that would have stepped away towards the more organically diverse curated music. Taking this into account, algorithms instead must replicate the sporadicity of organic recommendations, and determine methods of predicting new content the user will enjoy."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution to the problem of organic machine recommendation systems is the implementation of both batch and stochastic gradient descent methods, as well as k fold cross validation to create a system that is able to recommend things organically. Since our dataset contains much of the data regarding songs that we already need, batch gradient descent is well suited to create a principle set of weights for the algorithm to use, which can then be updated in real time using stochastic gradient descent. In this manner, the online nature of stochastic gradient descent will allow for the recommendation system to evolve with the users' preferences, and thus grow from the hot start generated by the batch gradient descent. The lighter computational complexity of stochastic gradient descent allows for the use of k folds cross validation as well,  allowing us to score new recommendations based on theorized metrics and determine how well the model is operating. By doing so, the stochastic algorithm weights can be changed if it is measured that recommendations do poorly, or reinforced if recommendations do well. In this manner, the algorithm can be tested, and would be viable to solving the issue of organic recommendation."

This is because we want to determine if the music that our machine learning model is predicting is actually music that makes sense to be played. One possiible way to determine how accurate our model is to create our own playlists/sets of songs and determining whether the music predicted by our model falls in that playlist. \n",
